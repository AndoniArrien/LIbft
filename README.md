## Overview

The **Libft** project is the foundational step in creating your own library, a collection of functions that will serve as a valuable toolkit throughout your coding journey in the 42 cursus. This project is divided into two parts: **Libc functions** and **Additional functions**.

## Part 1 - Libc Functions

In this section, you are tasked with recreating essential functions from the C Standard Library (Libc). The functions must have the same prototypes and behaviors as their original counterparts, but with a 'ft_' prefix. Examples include `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_strncmp`. Additionally, you'll implement memory allocation functions `ft_calloc` and `ft_strdup` using `malloc`.

## Part 2 - Additional Functions

The second part introduces functions that either extend the capabilities of Libc or offer new functionality. Some notable functions include:

- **ft_substr**: Allocates and returns a substring from a given string.
- **ft_strjoin**: Concatenates two strings and returns the result.
- **ft_strtrim**: Trims specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.
- **ft_split**: Splits a string into an array of strings using a specified delimiter.
- **ft_itoa**: Converts an integer to a string.
- **ft_strmapi**: Applies a function to each character of a string, creating a new string.
- **ft_lstnew**: Allocates and returns a new node for a linked list.
- ...and more.

## Bonus Part - Linked List Functions

For those seeking an extra challenge, the bonus part introduces linked list manipulation. You'll define a `t_list` structure and implement functions like `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, and others to interact with linked lists.
